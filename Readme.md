# Hire Duniya - Job Search Portal (Built in MinsðŸ”¥)

Hire Duniya is a modern job search portal that utilizes the **JSearch API**, **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**, and **ChatGPT** to provide a seamless job-hunting experience. This project was a fun experiment that helped me explore the possibilities of AI in web development, allowing me to go from scratch to a fully functional website in **less than 60 minutes**.

## Features
- **Search & Apply for Jobs**: Enter a job title, filter by location and job type, and find relevant job listings.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design.
- **Job Listings from JSearch API**: Fetches real-time job data from the API.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: ChatGPT helped streamline the design, logic, and implementation, reducing development time significantly.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Includes location and job type filters for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **JSearch API** (for fetching job data)
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)** (for modern, responsive design)
- **ChatGPT** (for assistance in logic, design, and troubleshooting)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (for interactivity and API integration)
- **HTML & CSS** (for the basic structure and styling)

## How It Works
1. Enter a job title in the search bar.
2. Filter jobs based on location and job type.
3. Browse results and click on a listing to view details.
4. Redirect to the job application page for further actions.

## Why This Project?
This project was a hands-on way to explore AI-assisted development. With the help of ChatGPT, I was able to:
- Generate and refine the UI design quickly.
- Implement API integrations efficiently.
- Debug and improve the overall logic in real-time.
- Experiment with new ideas without getting stuck.

## Future Enhancements
- **More Filtering Options** (Salary range, experience level, etc.)
- **User Authentication** (Save favorite jobs, track applications)
- **AI-Based Job Recommendations**
